					<h5><strong>Product Problem</strong></h5>
					<p>A problem can be broken down into smaller parts using an iterative method.&nbsp; This allows each sub section to be analysed to a greater amount of detail.&nbsp; The process helps to remove ambiguity in determining why something is happening, speeds up problem solving and removes wasted resources needed for solving similar problems in the future.</p>
					<p>The procedure below begins by assessing the impact of a problem in order to mitigate against its immediate effect.&nbsp; It then investigates internal and external causes.&nbsp; One question to consider is whether to investigate internal or external causes first. &nbsp;There is no right answer and the best strategy is likely linked to the change that has been observed from the data.&nbsp; I believe that by starting with an internal assessment, some obvious causes can be ruled out e.g. new feature X was released yesterday which changed the data in metric Y to change.</p>
					<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
					<ol>
					<li><strong>Impact:</strong>
					<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
					<li><em>Understand the problem:</em> What metric has been affected and what could this mean E.g. Has the user sign up or activation rate changed.&nbsp; Have any other metrics been affected? For example, a reduction in time spent using an app could be due to a recent update that increased the efficiency of performing a task?</li>
					<li><em>Assess Scale:</em> Is the problem affecting a single location or product line?</li>
					<li><em>Inform Stakeholders:</em> Do other stakeholders need to be informed about the problem?&nbsp;</li>
					<li><em>Mitigation:</em> What procedures need to be activated to stop or minimise the impact of the problem?</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Internal Causes:</strong>
					<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
					<li><em>Cross Analyse: </em>Check if the problem has occurred cross-product/platform or with a different team/location?</li>
					<li><em>Historical Data: </em>Check past data of the product for similar irregularities.&nbsp; When did the anomaly occur (time of day and day of week)? &nbsp;Is there an annual trend to the data?</li>
					<li><em>Assess growth models:</em> Does the growth model of the product predict the trends in the data until now?&nbsp; How did the anomaly affect the data (gradual/sharp change)?&nbsp; Do extrapolations from the old data set predict this new change?</li>
					<li><em>Internal Developments: </em>Has there been a new feature release, a defect that has been discovered, expiration of feature, security change?&nbsp; Check for user feedback to see what the customers are saying.&nbsp; Are there any common issues that users are complaining about?</li>
					<li><em>Demographic affected: </em>Is it only a certain demographic of users that have been impacted e.g. new users from the past three months, users in a certain age category?</li>
					<li><em>Business model:</em> Has there been any significant changes to the business model of the product e.g. the licensing model, seasonal changes to a products services, a free service has changed to a paid subscription.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li><strong>External Causes:</strong>
					<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
					<li><em>Competition: </em>Has a competitor changed their product or business model?&nbsp; Has a new competitor emerged in the market?&nbsp; </li>
					<li><em>Geopolitical: </em>Have there been any recent changes to government policy that could have restricted/altered access to a platform?&nbsp; Has there been a power outage or natural/human disaster?</li>
					<li><em>Network Issue:</em> Has there been an issue with a telecom provider that could have resulted in accessibility issues?&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
					<li><em>PR: </em>Has there been a bad PR case recently that affected the company?</li>
					<li><em>Regulations:</em> Has there been any legal changes that have come into effect?</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Internal Mitigations:</strong>
					<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
					<li>Internal changes are likely to cause a sharp change in the data. A new feature, a defect or a sudden change to the business model are likely to causes a sudden reaction from the users of the product.</li>
					<li>For a problem that has been identified as internal, a good strategy would be to work closely with the engineering team to isolate the problem and implement a fix.</li>
					<li>The severity of the problem determines the response needed. A critical problem might require the current work to be interrupted whereas a minor problem could be implemented in future work.&nbsp;</li>
					<li>Problems with new features can be mitigated by reversing the change to restore a previous version of the product. The new feature can then be reviewed to determine the root cause.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li><strong>External Mitigations:</strong>
					<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
					<li>External problems are more likely to cause a gradual change in the products data. For example, a competitor&rsquo;s gradual rise of market share or the slow implementation of a new law.&nbsp; This isn&rsquo;t a strict rule as many external factors can have sudden effects e.g. a natural disaster.</li>
					<li>For a problem that has been identified as external (e.g. a new competitor), a good strategy would be to continue the development procedure of the product whilst continuously assessing what changes could be introduced as mitigation.</li>
					<li>For external problems that have a temporary effect (e.g. seasonal weather), there may not me much action required and a gradual return to business is likely to follow.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					</ol>
					<p><strong>&nbsp;Example:</strong></p>
					<p><h4><strong><center><em>The performance of Uber went down in Norway?&nbsp; Identify the problem and form a plan to fix it?</em></strong></center></h4></p>
					<p></p>
					
					<ol>
					<li>Assessing the Impact.</li>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #00b050;">A:</span> What do you mean by the 'performance' of Uber in Norway? Does this refer to the user sign up rate, activation rate, time spent using the app, logins per day?&nbsp; Is this affecting both riders and drivers or just one party?</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0070c0;">Q: </span>The issue concerns a decrease in the number of drivers using the app.&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #00b050;">A:</span> What % decrease in drivers has been recorded? Is this a trend that concerns Month on Month (MoM) or Year on Year (YoY) data?</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0070c0;">Q: </span>There has been a 8% decrease in drivers MoM for the past three months.&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #00b050;">A:</span> Is the issue only affecting Norway?&nbsp; Are there any other countries within Europe or elsewhere that have been affected?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not familiar with the number of cities that Uber operates in Norway? Is Oslo the only city operating the service?</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0070c0;">Q:</span> Only Norway has been affected and you can assume Uber only operates in Oslo.</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #00b050;">A:</span> Is it just jus the ride sharing service that has been impacted or have other services been affected e.g. UberEATS, Bike/Scooter sharing?</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0070c0;">Q: </span>Just the ride sharing service has been affected.</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #00b050;">A: </span>Okay, the issue appears to be a regional problem but I will need to assess it further to make sure.&nbsp; For now, I will inform other product managers in Europe about the problem that we are experiencing to make them aware.</p>
					<p></p>
					<li>Assess Internal Causes.</li>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #00b050;">A:</span> Have there been any recent feature updates to the app in the last week? Are there any recent comments in the product store that provide useful information?&nbsp; Is the performance decrease seen on both Android and iOS platforms?&nbsp; Has there been an update to the terms and conditions for using the app?</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0070c0;">Q:</span> There have been no major feature updates recently or changes to the terms and conditions.&nbsp; The trend is affecting the app on both platforms and we do not have any data on user comments.</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #00b050;">A:</span> Prior to the three months in which the number of drivers have been decreasing, what has the month on month trend been for drivers registering/leaving the app? What has the trend in drivers been for the last year?&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0070c0;">Q: </span>Prior data shows that the number of drivers using the app was increasing at 5% per month (on average) for the past 18 months.</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #00b050;">A: </span>Okay, it sounds like the issue might be caused by an external factor.&nbsp; I am going to explore some external issues briefly before analysing internal issues further.</p>
					<p></p>
					<li>Assess External Causes.</li>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #00b050;">A:</span> Are we aware of any recent developments in a competitor&rsquo;s business model? Are competitors incentivising drivers to switch to their product?</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0070c0;">Q: </span>You don&rsquo;t need to worry about competitors for this question.</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #00b050;">A: </span>I think the change is unlikely to be caused by a network issue as the trend has been ongoing for three months.&nbsp; Similarly, I don&rsquo;t believe the problem to be caused be a geographical issue for similar reasoning.&nbsp; Has there been any regulatory change in Norway that could have affected the way Uber and other ride sharing apps operate in the country?</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0070c0;">Q: </span>This is not a factor to be concerned about.</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #00b050;">A: </span>Have we received any bad PR in Norway that could be affecting the region?</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0070c0;">Q: </span>There has been no significant change in the PR of Uber in Norway recently.</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #00b050;">A: </span>Has there been an update to the terms and conditions for using the app that has come into effect?</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;">There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be an obvious external factor causing the decline in drives.&nbsp; Due to the sharp decrease in users and since it is affecting drives specifically, I believe that the problem might be a bug affecting the user experience of drives.&nbsp; It might be an issue affecting a certain version of the app only and therefore only a certain percentage of drivers.</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0070c0;">Q: &nbsp;</span>You are in the right area.&nbsp; What would be your plan to mitigate against this?</p>
					<p></p>
					<li>Mitigation Strategy.</li>
					<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #00b050;">A: </span>Here is the strategy that I want to employ:</p>
					<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
					<li>This might be an issue which is unique to a certain version of the app that drivers are using. I want to start contacting drivers using various versions of the app and ask about their experience using the app over the past couple months.&nbsp; This might indicate a common frustration that drivers are experiencing.</li>
					<li>I could prompt drivers who are using older versions of the app to upgrade to the most recent update. However, I can&rsquo;t be sure that the problem is with an older version of the app so I think it is best to wait for the user feedback first.  Once received and if the feedback is correct to the cause of the problem, I would like to slowly rollout an upgrade (or downgrade) of the app to a percentage of drivers and receive feedback on this change.  If the subsequent feedback alleviates the problem, then I will enforce the change across all users.</li>
