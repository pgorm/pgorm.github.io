					<p><h5><strong>Lessons from Hackathons </strong></h5></p>
<p>At the beginning of 2019, I was involved in two Hackathons with Arm.&nbsp; The first was &lsquo;Hack Cambridge 4D&rsquo;, an annual event hosted by the University of Cambridge. It is part of the MLH (Major League Hacking) network and draws in a large crowd of students from Universities across Europe and farther afield (there were several students from the US and Canada!).&nbsp; I was involved in the judging process for Arm in which we were delivering the best &lsquo;Hardwar Hack&rsquo;.&nbsp; This prize was awarded to the team that came up with the most creative project that used at least one hardware component.&nbsp; We decided to award the prize to team &lsquo;Pill it Up&rsquo; for their creative use of a Raspberry Pi and Amazon Alexa smart speaker to implement a computer vision to successfully categorise medical tablets.</p>
<p>Two weeks later in early February, I was co-directing a Hackathon at the University of Bristol alongside the Bristol Electrical and Electronic Engineering Society (BEEES).&nbsp; The event was themed around Machine Learning and bought in over 50 students who built a range of exciting projects including a solar flare detector and an algorithm that tried to predict the winner of the event.... (to some success).&nbsp; I delivered a talk on 'Machine Learning at the Edge' (of the network) to showcase Arm's involvement in this area.&nbsp; The winning team was 'Eng Des' that constructed a 3D printed chessboard that used computer vision and a CNN (convoluted neural network) to map the movement of chess pieces.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun attending the events and they were both great successes.&nbsp; Reflecting on these two experiences, I found they offered great insight into the importance of operations and leadership:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ownership breads success.</strong> Arguably the most useful insight from the events was that to do something successfully you need to claim strong ownership.&nbsp; I believe this relies on understanding and outlining <strong>vision</strong>, <strong>mission</strong>, <strong>strategy</strong>, <strong>objectives </strong>and <strong>metrics</strong> to a project.&nbsp; Granted for a fun event like a Hackathon, there is no need to go into deep detail but the principles around these categories still apply.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Understanding technical development.</strong> Hackathons are creative endeavours that bring together a range of people with complimenting skills sets.&nbsp; Technical development is only one aspects of a Hackathon.&nbsp; The ability to understand the underlying principles and then marketing the idea is a completely different game.&nbsp; Some groups did this well, others didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; <strong>The events highlighted the value in being able to connect technical and business people together.</strong></li>
<li><strong>How to tell a story.</strong> Hackathons are dynamic and the fast paced.&nbsp; It is common for the final idea to have pivoted several times from the get-go.&nbsp; There was only a small amount of time to judge each group so the ability to outline a problem, attempts to solve it and what has been achieved.&nbsp; The best groups were those that understood the only visibility we had into their project was a brief two/three-minute pitch at the end.&nbsp; <strong>Being able to successfully convey a complex idea is one of the most important aspects of the event.&nbsp; </strong></li>
<li><strong>Making decisions under uncertainty</strong>. Not everything is going to go to plan with hosting an event.&nbsp; 24 hours is a short time (or long if you were up all night) to get something right so you need to be able to adapt quickly.&nbsp; Changing your pitch deck an hour before a presentation to add in a new idea or using Excel to reduce the tallying of scores (before catching a train) were two things I did not anticipate. <strong>Constantly assessing the how and why of doing something often leads to the greatest (10X) insights.&nbsp; </strong>These insights were much more important then stressing over the detail in slide 7. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Strong communication skills</strong>. Organising an event is tough work. Communicating with different groups of people to make sure that everyone is aligned is incredibly important for the success of the event.&nbsp; <strong>Making sure that message is clear ensures minimal back and forth correspondence and saves a tremendous amount of time.&nbsp; </strong>Adapt your communication to different audiences, some groups will be easier to work with than others, try and be clear and brief regardless.</li>
