<p><h4><strong><center>1 week, 1 month and 1 year as a Project Manager</center></strong></h4></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling reflective this September after passing my 1 year anniversary at Arm (boy does time fly!)</p>
<p>I joined arm as graduate project manager and have been in the deep end since starting work on the Arm Compiler.&nbsp; A complex project from a technical viewpoint but it also has a significant number of products, people and processes to manage.</p>
<p>Here are some of the key lessons that I have learnt over the past year.</p>
<p><strong>1 week</strong></p>
<p>Thinking back:</p>
<p>Following a fantastic two day onboarding event at the Tamburlaine hotel, I started my first day with a quick introduction to the team that I was going to be working with.&nbsp; It was a time of meeting new people and fostering new relationships with project managers, engineering, support and product management.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also learnt that I was going to be spending the remainder of the week on an external course in order to become a Certified Scrum Master.&nbsp; The course was fantastic and foreshadowed Arm&rsquo;s commitment to providing continuous development opportunities for graduates at this early stage of our careers.</p>
<p>It was a great opportunity to meet a variety of people across my group while establishing early relationships with a number of people in my team.</p>
<p><strong>1 month</strong></p>
<p>Luckily, I wrote down some notes from this period.&nbsp; Looking back, a lot of this still holds true:</p>
<p>Fundamental to project management is time management.&nbsp; The complexity of large software project means you cannot do everything that you set out to do in a week.&nbsp; Prioritising work and offloading tasks to the team is critical if you want to keep your head above the water.</p>
<p>People management was another early area that I got involved in.&nbsp; There are a number of internal (product management, support, docs) and external (contractors, senior management, other groups) stakeholders that you will be in contact with.&nbsp; It is important to understand the various personalities that will be involved in the project and how to best accommodate and respond to their concerns.</p>
<p>Process.&nbsp; It creates overhead for any project but is necessary for teams working on continuous development projects to learn and improve with each iteration.&nbsp; Process allows slips to be caught and holds people accountable.&nbsp; If you can contribute to a process and improve it then you can add value&hellip; or you can remove redundant processes that are time sinks for the team.</p>
<p>The fourth major lesson I learnt during this month was respect.&nbsp; Central to being a PM is being a facilitator.&nbsp; You remove obstacles, connect people, organise chaos and make sure high-level goals are met.&nbsp; This involves working with people who need to respect your insight and judgement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think my greatest challenge at this point is understanding as much as I can about the people, processes and project so that I can contribute and help as early as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1 year</strong></p>
<p>Over the course of a year a lot can (read: will) change within a project: people join/leave, requirements change, deadlines shift.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a balancing act that requires constant focus and thought about what is around the corner.</p>
<p>Heated arguments will happen at some point during a project.&nbsp; As a project manager it important to remain calm and think clearly during these times.&nbsp; Listening to others while being pragmatic is essential to resolving potential escalations.</p>
<p>Managing a project is the easy part.&nbsp; People management is complex and problems that arise here are often not easy to solve.&nbsp; It will take time, multiple approaches and reinforcing your thoughts in order to change people.</p>
<p>Alignment is essential and you can never be too aligned.&nbsp; Continuous communication to stakeholders and double-checking requirements removes unforeseen blockades later on, no matter how sure you are that everyone is on the same page.</p>
<p>Every meeting I am in I like to take brief notes that I can reread later on or send out as a summary.&nbsp; This has removed ambiguity on countless occasions and prevented repeated mistakes.&nbsp; Informal meetings are great for quick discussions but lack clarity and strong actions.&nbsp;&nbsp; These notes have allowed me to cross reference and strategize important decisions.</p>
<p>People love progress. Nobody likes the thought of being stuck on a task/project for too long.&nbsp; Extracting date and visualizing this to the team has been great for breaking down big goals and motivating people.</p>
<p>Early on I realised how important it was to have a strategy/plan for each goal.&nbsp; Even though a plan is essential to the strategy of a project, influence and execution are significantly more difficult to figure out.</p>
<p>Effort/time constraints are fundamental to making decisions.&nbsp; Management decisions aren&rsquo;t binary (normally) and are used on the best available data at the time.&nbsp; They should get better with time and the more reliable the data, the better the team can execute.</p>
<p>Enabling others to talk has been incredibly rewarding.&nbsp; It is important to spot when someone wants to join a conversation but is not confident enough to jump in and interrupt.</p>
<p>Ingest information, structure it, communicate it. Repeat.</p>
<p>The team you work with are the most important factor for project success.&nbsp; Having an intelligent and motivated team is critical and should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>Finally, I think the number of wins that you experience in management is significantly less when compared to compiling code or completing sprints.&nbsp; However, the problem solving still remains and achieving the big goals brings tremendous satisfaction.</p>
