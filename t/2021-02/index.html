						<h4>Doing the work and creating change</h4>
						<p>In life there is no substitute for doing the work.&nbsp; The &lsquo;work&rsquo; can take many different forms: exercise, investing, sleeping to name a few. &nbsp;Doing the work requires you to be mindful of an area and put action towards it.&nbsp; Since these actions are cyclic by nature they rely on a certain amount of self-discipline.&nbsp; They also compound over time and are easy to manage (in theory) but&hellip; why should you care?</p>
<p>Before we jump in lets first discuss how things can be classified as unknown or known (to various shades of grey).&nbsp; Ever since you were a child you might have heard consistent messaging to &lsquo;eat a balanced diet&rsquo; or to &lsquo;do everything in moderation&rsquo;.&nbsp; But say you were never told this when you grew up, it might be a long time before you realise that eating a certain diet makes you feel fine while a different diet makes you feel lethargic. &nbsp;A simple difference between unknown and known.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The information above is useful on its own but also uncomplete and doesn&rsquo;t guarantee change.&nbsp; The next shade of &lsquo;knowing something&rsquo; might come when we hear someone we know talk about their healthy diet and corresponding weight loss. &nbsp;Here tribalism starts to take effect as someone close to us gives apparent evidence that this works.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s next?&nbsp; Well, we might try this ourselves; not too fast and not all at once is the most common practice e.g. incorporating more vegetables at dinner or swapping out soda for water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We might be in this phase for some time as small gains take time to compound and for the results to be seen.&nbsp; The good news is that a habit has started to form.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you take the experimental approach of incorporating another vegetable at dinner time and holding yourself accountable, then the compounding machine keeps on building.</p>
<p>The story above is nice but probably one we have all heard before.&nbsp; So why do so many people stop at this point and fall back into old habits?&nbsp; What I found to be helpful when transitioning from unknown to habit is a compensating book that allows oneself to combine theory with action.&nbsp; Here are some examples:</p>
<p>Sleep.&nbsp; Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker is the book on sleep science.&nbsp; Its fascinating to read about the many benefits that sleep has on your wellbeing, health, sex life, work life.&nbsp; Consistent sleep is one of our main sources of energy.&nbsp; We need both REM and NREM sleep for rest and learning, getting by on less sleep interrupts sleep cycles that allow us to get both.&nbsp; I despise hustle culture and the people grinding it out on minimal sleep in order to make more gains.&nbsp; It is often bad practice in the long run.</p>
<p>Diet.&nbsp; Fiber Fueled by Will Bulsiewicz touches on the importance of diet.&nbsp; It explains the benefits of plant diversity in ones diet, progress over perfection when building eating habits and taking the time to train up your gut fitness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investing.&nbsp; The Richest Man in Babylon by George Samuel Clason explains the beauty of compound interest.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a short read but gets the point across through a series of stories.&nbsp; What you should know about investing money and the compound effect is it takes time to build up and once it starts you should not stop its momentum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exercise.&nbsp; Rather then a book I think the best &lsquo;in&rsquo; for exercise is finding a sport or activity you enjoy that you look forward to each day.&nbsp; Once you have found this its easier to keep the momentum going as you feel and see benefits.&nbsp; Anecdotally, my experience with running in high school or rowing in the gym has been to accept and enjoy the pain.&nbsp; It started out with wanting to be the best, but it turned into a focus and desire to push myself to the limit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are many other habits in which doing the work pays dividends.&nbsp; Stretching and mindfulness/meditation are two that I think have great benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would be interested to hear where you are putting in the work.</p>
