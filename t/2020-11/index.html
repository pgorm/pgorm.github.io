						<h4>Building Influence</h4>
						<p>
						<p>There are certain professions where the accountabilities of a role are outside of your direct control i.e. indirect control over resources.&nbsp; Project and product management both fall into this category.&nbsp; Project management roles in technology involve managing a project that crosses the disciplines of engineering, product, support &amp; IT.&nbsp; Product management works with internal stakeholders in engineering, project, support/sales and external customers in order to build a product.&nbsp; Neither of these lists are extensive (and for good reason, they could be very long).&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that these roles are largely driven by influence; working with and leading colleagues to accomplish tasks that will benefit the business.&nbsp; Influence overs someone can take different forms depending on the type of the relationship that you have with someone, but it often builds upon: trust, communication &amp; empathy.</p>
<p>Starting out my career in a management role, here are some of the things that have helped me:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Doing small tasks well &ndash; Understanding a large complex project takes time. Build up small wins and take on work at your own pace. Under promise but over deliver.</li>
<li>Talk to the team &amp; stakeholders &ndash; Try to understand pain points early on. What is common? What is important? Listen for now before overpromising.</li>
<li>Be present if you can &ndash; Physical presence brings with it a greater sense of trust. Try to stick to a consistent schedule of being available in person and have room in your calendar. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Willingness &amp; Optimism &ndash; There is no substitute for doing the work and showing you are committed to the team. At the same time, it is crucial to show optimism in your messaging, always measuring progress and showing how we can be better.</li>
</ul>
