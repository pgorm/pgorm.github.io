						<h4>Summer Reads</h4>

						<ul>
						  <li type="circle"><i>Stillness is the key by Ryan Holiday </i> - One of the first books I have read on Stoicism and a great primer it has been.  Even before formally reading about stoicism I have felt like the principles have been drilled into me from an early age.  Ryan touches on achieving a state of stillness (figuratively but literally too I suppose!) in life, comfortable with the path you are on and what you want from your life.  I think this is a noble goal and one that is easily forgotten as we age but thought of later in life.  The stories of past figures who practiced stoicism where engaging and interesting.  I hope to read Meditations by Marcus Aurelius soon.  <strong>9/10 </strong></li>

						 <li type="circle"><i>The Innovators by Walter Isaacson </i> – Insightful, inspiring, and exquisitely written.  The history of the information age is fascinating for anyone with a background in computers.  Walter drives home the point that ‘great’ innovations in history were a combination of talented individuals who had the foresight to leap forward into the unknown and those who could facilitate people together.  It elaborates on the wider challenges that innovation faces from technical problems to patents to government. The book isn’t as dry as it might seem as Walter leaves a significant portion of the book to the individuals themselves; what drove them, what were they were like, how where they brought up etc.  <strong>9.5/10 </strong></li>

						 <li type="circle"><i>A short history of nearly everything by Bill Bryson </i> – Almost 20 years late to reading this one (it has been on my bookshelf for some time now!) buy an enjoyable read, nonetheless.  Bryson writing is addictive and through no easy job, pulls off a fascinating story of the universe, earth and life.  Let’s make no mistake though, this book is non-fiction with a well detailed section of references for those curious to find out more.  The parts about astronomy, geology and human history were of most interest to me.  The parts on biological taxonomy and cell structure, not so much. It has stood the test of time with a lot of points remaining relevant in this day of age. The final chapter drives home an important point about the destructive past humans have shown to other life on the earth.   <strong> 8/10</strong></li>
